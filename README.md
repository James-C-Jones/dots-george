 **LetsHaveKiddos** | **George**
===========================

This is a revised version of my George theme. 


A theme made for a cat named George. 
A stray decided to follow me into my house one day and even though we've given him opportunities to leave he's chosen to stay. 
I love the little guy.

The (picom) window "dimming" effect isn't actually that strong, I had it at a stronger setting for screenshots, its much more subtle in actual use.
